# Data Clustering using K-means Algorithm

Made by Bolohan Stefan-Tudor

### Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the K-means algorithm. The algorithm is used to cluster data points into a number of clusters, using scikit-learn library. The algorithm is implemented in Python and uses the matplotlib library to visualize the data points and the clusters. Also, it uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimension of the data and visualize the clusters in 2D and compare the results with the original data.

It uses a [wine quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), which contains 12 features and a target variable (quality). It can be found on uciml repository.
